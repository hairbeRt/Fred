# Fred ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derohde/Fred/master/logo/logo.png "Fred logo")
A fast, scalable and light-weight C++ Fr√©chet distance library, exposed to python and focused on (k,l)-clustering of polygonal curves.

# Goal of this fork

Make small useful extensions to Fred, first of all to allow dynamic handling of curves from the python-side of the interface.

See [the original repository](https://github.com/derohde/Fred) for useful information.
